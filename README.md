Bad Behavior
============

This is a port of Bad Behavior 2.2.7 found at http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/ from PHP to Erlang.

Bad Behavior transcends other link spam solutions by working in a completely different, unique
way. Instead of merely looking at the content of potential spam, Bad Behavior analyzes the
delivery method as well as the software the spammer is using. In this way, Bad Behavior can
stop spam attacks even when nobody has ever seen the particular spam before.

Bad Behavior is designed to work alongside existing spam prevention services to increase their
effectiveness and efficiency. Whenever possible, you should run it in combination with a more
traditional spam prevention service.

The core of Bad Behavior is free software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License,
version 3, or at your option, any later version.
